> Browser extension that simplifies the Twitter interface and adds useful features

We use Twitter a lot and notice many dumb annoyances we'd like to fix. So here be dragons.


*This is reusing the name from the [original Refined Twitter](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-twitter-old) project, which tried to use the mobile Twitter version on the desktop. It was a good idea in theory, but not in practise. This extension instead improves upon the desktop version of Twitter.*


## Install

- [**Chrome** extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/refined-twitter/nlfgmdembofgodcemomfeimamihoknip)
- **Firefox** add-on: Use [this](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chrome-store-foxified/) to enable installing Chrome extensions and then install [Refined Twitter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/refined-twitter/nlfgmdembofgodcemomfeimamihoknip)
- **Opera** extension: Use [this](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/download-chrome-extension-9/) to enable installing Chrome extensions and then install [Refined Twitter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/refined-twitter/nlfgmdembofgodcemomfeimamihoknip)


## Highlights

- Simplified and improved UI.
- Uses the system font (San Francisco on macOS).
- Improves the scrolling performance of twitter.com
- Auto-loads new tweets in the stream if you're scrolled to the top. No more clicking "See 3 new Tweets"!
- Replaces the Twitter emoji with native ones.
- Hides "Notifications" activity for new followers and being added to a list.
- [Removes the annoying suggestions in the search popover](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/170270/33800304-70198358-dd3d-11e7-9870-477a44f74f4d.png)
- Fixes the file extension when saving images in tweets. No more `foo.jpg_large`!
- Uses the original image in tweet image galleries.
- Prevents DM modal from closing when clicking outside the modal.
- Hides "Liked" tweets in the stream.

Tip: Twitter has a native [dark mode](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-twitter/issues/10).

## Customization

We're happy to receive suggestions and contributions, but be aware this is a highly opinionated project. There's a very high bar for adding options.

This doesn't necessarily limit you from manually disabling functionality that is not useful for you. Options include:

1. *(CSS Only)* Use a Chrome extension that allows injecting custom styles into sites, based on a URL pattern. [Stylish](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en) is one such tool. [Example](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github/issues/136#issuecomment-204072018)

2. Clone the repository, make the adjustments you need, and [load the unpacked extension in Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked), rather than installing from the Chrome Store.


## Contribute

Suggestions and pull requests are highly encouraged!

In order to make modifications to the extension you'd need to run it locally.

Please follow the below steps:

```sh

npm install    # Install dev dependencies
npm run build  # Build the extension code so it's ready for the browser
npm run watch  # Listen for file changes and automatically rebuild
```

Once built, load it in the browser of your choice:

<table>
